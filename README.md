# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data, tracking cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and time periods. The analysis is delivered as a Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire data science workflow: data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight generation.

## 🎯 Features

- **Complete Data Pipeline**: From raw data to insights and visualizations
- **Multi-Country Analysis**: Compare trends across different countries and regions
- **Time Series Visualization**: Track pandemic waves and patterns over time
- **Vaccination Impact Assessment**: Analyze vaccination rollout and its effects
- **Interactive Maps**: Choropleth visualizations of global case and vaccination rates
- **Death Rate Analysis**: Examine fatality rates and their evolution

## 📋 Requirements

## 📁 Project Structure

- `covid19_global_tracker.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all analysis
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages
- `data/`: Directory for data files (will be downloaded when running the notebook)

## 📊 Analysis Components

The notebook guides you through:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Sourcing reliable COVID-19 data from Our World in Data

2. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Understanding the dataset structure and content

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Cases and deaths over time
   - Death rate analysis
   - Comparison across countries

5. **Vaccination Analysis**
   - Tracking vaccination progress globally
   - Comparing fully vs. partially vaccinated populations
   - Examining vaccination effects on outcomes

6. **Geographic Visualization**
   - Choropleth maps showing global distribution of cases and vaccinations

7. **Insights & Reporting**
   - Key findings and data-driven insights
   - Limitations and considerations when interpreting results

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Multiple pandemic waves occurred globally with regional timing variations
- Death rates generally declined over time as testing, treatments, and vaccinations improved
- Higher vaccination rates correlate with lower death rates in later waves
- Significant disparities exist in vaccination coverage between countries
- Testing and reporting differences make direct country comparisons challenging

## 🔍 Data Sources

This project uses data from [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data), which compiles data from multiple sources including:

- Johns Hopkins University
- World Health Organization
- European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
- National government reports
